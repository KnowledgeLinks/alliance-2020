        <h3>First Quarter - Simplify &amp; Scale RDF Publishing Workflows</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Building upon the early 2017 and 2018 BIBFRAME RDF publishing experiments, 
          the goal for the first quarter of 2020 is to simplify the technology for 
          transforming the Alliance membership MARC records into BIBFRAME RDF in order to 
          scale the service for publishing to the web. 
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to add an option to the current Goldrush service to allow 
         libraries to select a subset of their holdings and be able to 
         publish their MARC holdings as Schema.org RDF to the web using an explicit 
         URL pattern with additional institutional information. Libraries would also 
         have the option to download BIBFRAME RDF resources of their selected holdings.
       </p>
       <h4>Summary of Existing Technology &amp; Workflows</h4>
       <p>The existing Alliance BIBCAT implementation of using the 
        <a href="https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Blazegraph</a> 
        triplestore technology that has been effectively abandoned by it's original developers
        (although the main developers are now employed by Amazon and with the Blazegraph stack used
        as the basis for Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/">Neptune</a> graph 
        database service.
       </p>
       <p>
        The BIBFRAME RDF is stored in relational database Postgres database that is transformed
        into HTML RDFa using the Schema.org ontology that is cached on the 
        filesystem along with the sitemaps of the Alliance member libraries. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Beside the RDf web publishing pipeline for the libraries MARC records,
        we will also provide the option for libraries to receive a download of
        files in a variety of RDF serializations like XML, n-triples, or 
        Turtle. Using the BIBFRAME ontology, the libraries Works will be 
        de-duplicated with other BIBFRAME Works in the Alliance's collection
        with their specific BIBFRAME Instances. 
      </p>
      <h4>Open Questions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Add storage to existing Goldrush database, using new tables and indices?</li>
        <li>Continue use of Elasticsearch for web publishing?</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Proposed Technology</h4>
      <p>
        Java RDF middleware runs the individual MARC21 records to MARC XML that is then 
        transformed into the BIBFRAME RDF and stored in a Postgres database, possibly using 
        the <a href="https://www.trellisldp.org/">Trellis</a> as an API layer. 
      </p>
      <h4>Proposed Workflow</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>Library staff, using the Goldrush UI, searches for MARC records that want converted to
           BIBFRAME
         </li>
         <li>
           Backend process is kicked off:
           <ol>
	     <li>
                First checks for existing BIBFRAME Instances and Works associated with the Goldrush match key
             </li>
             <li>If BIBFRAME Instance(s) or Work(s) are not found,
                 the MARC record is serialized as XML, run through the Library of Congress 
           	 <a href="https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2">marc2bibframe</a> XSLT to produce 
                BIBFRAME RDF. The RDF is then stored in Postgres
             </li>
             <li>
               The BIBFRAME RDF is transformed into 
               <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema</a> JSON-LD and an HTML5 representation is then
               cached.
             </li>
             <li>
               The Alliance sitemap is updated to reflect the changes.
             </li>
            </ol>
         <li>
	   An email is sent to the library staff member notifying them of their newly published 
           RDF

      <h3>Second Quarter - Search Engine Indexing and Publishing</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        Insure that Libraries collections published as web resources are indexed and available
        through <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> searching; secondary support for 
        search engines such as Microsoft <a href="https://bing.com/">Bing</a> and 
        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. In addition, libraries that want to 
        increase their collection search ranking, generated HTML pages that links back to their 
        Gold Rush &#127; web resources will be available for inclusion in their own web sites. 
      </p>
      <p>Web published RDF resource to be indexed by 
         Google, Microsoft Bing, and DuckDuckGo web search engines. In the prior 2016-2018 Gold
         Rush&#127; Bibcat experiments, a major negative outcome was that Google did not index
         the sitemaps of the web-published RDF resources. To mitigate this outcome, we suggest
         including Richard Wallis of <a href="https://www.dataliberate.com/">Data Librate</a> in 
         this phase to troubleshoot and suggest changes for improving the Google indexing of 
         the Alliance's web published resources.

      <h3>Third Quarter - Sinopia Authority Source</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        The <a href="https://sinopia.io">Sinopia</a> linked data editor 
        will be finishing up it's third development work-cycle at the end 
        of second quarter to the beginning of the third quarter of 2020.
        With the new Alliance RDF publishing services that will be developed 
        in first and second quarters, we should advocate that the Alliance's 
        Goldrush BIBCAT service as an authority source for users to search and
        link to Alliance resources in the creation of linked data resources in 
        Sinopia.
      </p>
      <p>Sinopia's current authorities comes from two sources; the Library of Congress 
      Linked Data Services at <a href="http://id.loc.gov/">id.loc.gov</a> and the Cornell University/
      University of Iowa <a href="https://lookup.ld4l.org/">Questioning Authority</a> service.
      <h4>Technology</h4>
      <p>
        Sinopia uses an 
        <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md">Open API</a> 
        (formally known as a Swagger specification) for defining the interactions between the 
        Questioning Authority service and the Sinopia editor. 
      </p>
      <p>  
        Part of the expected Sinopia's third work-cycle deliverables is an 
        attempt to make the supporting infrastructure for Sinopia more cloud 
        agnostic instead of being so tightly coupled to Amazon Web Services like
        Cognito and Fargate.
      </p>
     <h4>Open Questions</h4>
     <ol>
       <li>Would <a href="https://www.ld4l.org/">LD4P</a> be open to a new authority source by 
           the Alliance?</li>
       <li>Is supporting a new Sinopia authority feasible?</li>
     </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h3>Fourth Quarter - Hosted Sinopia Editor</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        As <a href="https://sinopia.io">Sinopia</a> is licensed under
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2</a>, the source code
        is available for use and extending. Given that Sinopia's initial design goals was supporting
        multiple institutions in a collaborative cloud environment, an Alliance hosted version
        would add another service for it's membership to do original and copy-cataloging in a native
        linked-data environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a successful launch of RDF publishing
        pipeline for the Alliance membership, a hosted version of Sinopia by the 
        Alliance would allow library staff to edit the converted RDF resources and
        also allow the membership to create new RDF resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current iteration of Sinopia uses Docker containers with the following
        structure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
	   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> server for delivery of a 
           <a href=https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application using 
           <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> for a rich client-side Javascript RDF editor.
        </li>
        <li>
           The storage-layer for Sinopia uses <a href="https://www.trellisldp.org/">Trellis</a>, an 
           open-source <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">linked-data platform</a> with a 
           <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> relational database backend.
       </li>
        <li>
           A Node.js middleware applications for managing Trellis group permissions and for indexing
           the resources in Trellis into a 
	   <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> search index.
        </li>
      </ul>
     <h4>Open Questions</h4>
     <ol>
       <li>Would Alliance libraries find such a Linked Data Editor useful or valuable?</li>
       <li>Is the additional complexity of Sinopia stack too much overhead to support?</li>
       <li>How to keep the active development of the Sinopia Editor in sync with the Alliance's 
           hosted version?</li>
     </ol>

    <em>We believe that</em> libraries must be able to transform their MARC records to RDF
    <em>is essential</em> for patrons usage of the library. <em>This will achieve</em> improved 
    discovery of library collections by search engines. <em>We will have demonstrated this when
    we can measure</em> search engine indexing of over 90% of the library's published collections.
