        <h3>First &amp; Second Quarters - Build RDF Publishing Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
         We want to add an option to the current Goldrush service, and option
         for libraries to select a subset of their holdings and be able to 
         publish their MARC holdings as RDF to the web to be indexed by 
         Google, Microsoft Bing, and DuckDuckGo web search engines.        
       </p>
       <p>
        The BIBFRAME RDF is stored in Postgres database that is transformed
        into HTML RDFa using the Schema.org ontology that is cached on the 
        filesystem along with the sitemaps of the Alliance member libraries. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Beside the RDf web publishing pipeline for the libraries MARC records,
        we will also provide the option for libraries to receive a download of
        files in a variety of RDF serializations like XML, n-triples, or 
        Turtle. Using the BIBFRAME ontology, the libraries Works will be 
        de-duplicated with other BIBFRAME Works in the Alliance's collection
        with their specific BIBFRAME Instances. 
      </p>
      <h4>Technology</h4>
      <p>
        Java RDF middleware runs the individual MARC21 records to MARC XML that is then 
        transformed into the BIBFRAME RDF and stored in a Postgres database, possibly using 
        the <a href="https://www.trellisldp.org/">Trellis</a> as an API layer. This would replace
        the existing Alliance BIBCAT implementation of using the 
        <a href="https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Blazegraph</a> 
        triplestore technology that has been effectively abandoned by it's original developers
        (although the main developers are now employed by Amazon and with the Blazegraph stack used
        as the basis for Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/">Neptune</a> graph 
        database service.
      </p>
      <h4>Proposed Workflow</h4>
      <ol>
         <li>Library staff, using the Goldrush UI, searches for MARC records that want converted to
           BIBFRAME
         </li>
         <li>
           Backend process is kicked off:
           <ol>
	     <li>
                First checks for existing BIBFRAME Instances and Works associated with the Goldrush match key
             </li>
             <li>If BIBFRAME Instance(s) or Work(s) are not found,
                 the MARC record is serialized as XML, run through the Library of Congress 
           	 <a href="https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2">marc2bibframe</a> XSLT to produce 
                BIBFRAME RDF. The RDF is then stored in Postgres
             </li>
             <li>
               The BIBFRAME RDF is transformed into 
               <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema</a> JSON-LD and an HTML5 representation is then
               cached.
             </li>
             <li>
               The Alliance sitemap is updated to reflect the changes.
             </li>
            </ol>
         <li>
	   An email is sent to the library staff member notifying them of their newly published 
           RDF

      <h3>Third &amp; Forth Quarter - Hosted Sinopia Services</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://sinopia.io">Sinopia</a> linked data editor 
        will be finishing up it's third development work-cycle at the end 
        of second quarter to the beginning of the third quarter of 2020.
        With the new Alliance RDF publishing services that will be developed 
        in first and second quarters, we should advocate that the Alliance's 
        Goldrush BIBCAT service as an authority source for users to search and
        link to Alliance resources in the creation of linked data resources in 
        Sinopia.
      </p>
      <h4>Technology</h4>
      <p>  
        Part of the expected Sinopia's third work-cycle deliverables is an 
        attempt to make the supporting infrastructure for Sinopia more cloud 
        agnostic instead of being so tightly coupled to Amazon Web Services like
        Cognito and Fargate. Given a successful launch of RDF publishing
        pipeline for the Alliance membership, a hosted version of Sinopia by the 
        Alliance would allow library staff to edit the converted RDF resources and
        also allow the membership to create new RDF resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current iteration of Sinopia uses Docker containers with the following
        structure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
	   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> server for delivery of a 
           <a href=https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application using 
           <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> for a rich client-side Javascript RDF editor.
        </li>
        <li>
           The storage-layer for Sinopia uses <a href="https://www.trellisldp.org/">Trellis</a>, an 
           open-source <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">linked-data platform</a> with a 
           <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> relational database backend.
       </li>
        <li>
           A Node.js middleware applications for managing Trellis group permissions and for indexing
           the resources in Trellis into a 
	   <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> search index.
        </li>
      </ul>
